    "It's more likely that your first choice of door is a dud, so when one of the other doors is revealed to be a dud, you should change your choice to the last remaining door to have a 2/3 chance of winning the prize. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Rule applies to this because given that the host shows a dud door, this changes the probability of the car being behind the other doors because now all the probability of the car being behind a door you DIDN'T choose is in the remaining door.  You should always switch your choice."
